         <h1>How I whanted to be a Web designer</h1>
         <p> I've been interested in the web industry and design for a few years, but I'm only interested in it, and I didn't know much about what kind of work it is. At that time, I lived in Canada, so I prioritized studying English. Around that time, I found that my roommate is a web designer, and had the opportunity to ask in detail about my work, which made me even more interested. From that time on, I started to think about being a web designer. Then I started learinig WEb design agter I came back to Japan.

         <p>Font and Color<br>
          It decides the impression of the site, and even the color is slightly different, it is completly different web site to be.
          There are millions of colors and fonts, it is hard to decided to choose one.<br>
          Even through I look it up on Pintrerst fot the color and font, it's little bit different that I imagined of.
           <br><br>
 
           Coding<br>
          I learnd HTML and CSS basic, still didn't know how I start. Even thought I coded the website, still struggle to arrange the layouts and so on. It is a long way to go!

         <h1>What I felt when I studied web design-part2</h1>
         <p>
          Every day I have been struggling since I started studying, but I felt is that it is fun. Because it suits me to constantly shape new ideas, try and error one by one, and proceed with coding while actually checking. Also, as I continued to study, I began to want to learn more. "I want to try that! I want to try this too!" I still need to improve my techniques but, the motivation to learn is rising.<br> It's fun to put my ideas into shape, and I wish I could be involved in many productions in the future.

          Motivation and aspirationsbr<br>
          Personality I am interested in various things and loves to learn. In particular, studying as a web designer has a lot to learn, and I'm excited about it. Also, I will strive with aspirations to get closer to my ideal image of web designer that I want to be.

        Communication skills<br>

I have many expoerience talking with different kind of people so that communication skill is my strengths.
